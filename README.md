# Decision-Tree  
* It has been implemented from scratch
* In this exercise, our goal is to implement the decision tree with the ID3 algorithm. (We followed this implementation in Python and in the vscode editor). Also, checking the validity of the model built on the training and test data is investigated. (The training data will include a different percentage of the total data each time, and also 6 and 8 depths will be checked to determine the tree model). The criterion for evaluating the priority of different features at different depths for each branch of the tree will be "information gain" and also "Gini coefficient". In the continuation of the implementation and checking the effect of considering the validation data, the pruning operation will be implemented to increase the accuracy of the tree on the validation data. (Accidental pruning will also be considered). Finally, we will draw the change curve of the classification error on all three sets of validation, train and test for the number of different nodes in the tree and analyze it.
